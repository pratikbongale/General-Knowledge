LCM :
  common factors as well as uncommon factors are considered.
  greatest power of both.
HCF :
  only common factors are considered.
  smallest power of common factors
  
|x.y| = lcm x hcf

gcd(0,0) gives division by 0 error
lcm(0,0) = 0 is a special case

Eucledians formula is more efficient to find GCD.
  It says that subtracting the larger of two numbers from the smaller number gives you a number such that
  the gcd of this number and smaller number is same. So you can have such repeated subtractions.
  ex: 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 (252 = 21 × 12 and 105 = 21 × 5), and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and 147 = 252 − 105.
  Psuedocode:
  function gcd(a, b)
    while a ≠ b 
        if a > b
           a := a − b; 
        else
           b := b − a; 
    return a;
  
  but what if the difference is very large (1000,2)
  so a modified version of the above theorem says that you can divide the number and go on finding remainders.
  ex: a = 1071 and b = 462, 
      1071 = 2 × 462 + 147 
      462 = 3 × 147 + 21
      147 = 7 × 21 + 0
  
  Pseudocode:
  function gcd(a, b)
    while b ≠ 0
       t := b; 
       b := a mod b; 
       a := t; 
    return a;
