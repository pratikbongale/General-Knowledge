Prime numbers:
  find the closest sqrt <= number to be checked and check only the prime factors upto that number.
  Reason: checking 17 - you may see 2,3,4 but 4 = 2 x 2, so it must already have been checked that if 17 was not divided by 2 it will not be divisible by 4.
  Note: all primes can be written as 6k+-1 except 2 and 3, because, all integers can be written as 6k+-i for some integer k and i = {-1,0,1,2,3,4}
      2 divides (6k + 0), (6k + 2), (6k + 4); and 3 divides (6k + 3). 
  So a more efficient method is to test if n is divisible by 2 or 3, then to check through all the numbers of form 6k+-1<=sqrt(n)
  Psuedocode:
  function is_prime(integer)
    if n ≤ 1
        return false
    else if n ≤ 3
        return true
    else if n mod 2 = 0 or n mod 3 = 0
        return false
    // Now we check all 6k+1 and 6k-1
    let i ← 5   // this is 6k-1 for k = 1
    while i×i ≤ n
        if n mod i = 0 or n mod (i + 2) = 0       // n mod (i+2) is 6k+1 for k = 1
            return false
        i ← i + 6
    return true
